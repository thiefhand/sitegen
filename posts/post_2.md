Reclaimer™, our fist game, has been in development for nine months now! We are getting close to officially announcing this project and publishing a free demo to the world. Currently, we are taking our time to make this early version as good as possible and give players a solid idea of what Reclaimer™ will become. Much of our work has been done in the shadows, but we are excited to share the progress we have made thus far very soon! Keep an eye out for a steam page and additional updates on our social media channels. Feel free to join our discord channel and say hi!
